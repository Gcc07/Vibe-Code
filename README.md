1. What did you build? - I built a game called psychospeeder, you play as a car/spaceship type thing who dodges explosive buildings on a wacky looking road. There is a game loop, with a point system.
2. What language(s) or tools did you use? -
I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS. As far as I know, that was all that was used.
3. Which AI tools did you use, and how?
I used something called Cursor (AI powered text editor, like VSCODE combined with chatGPT), in combination with thigns like augment, (VSCODE Plugin), CoPilot (Initially, though I moved away from it once I started using Cursor), and that was it. Cursor did most of the heavy lifting though.
4. What did you do versus what AI helped with? -
I acted more just as a project manager. I tried to stay away from actually editing and fixing the code, because I feel like it can mess up the AI. I tried to keep it strictly vibe oriented. Whenever I got an error, or a visual bug I simply told the Cursor editor what was happening and what needed to be fixed enough times until it fixed itself. If there was something that really just didn't want to work I would revert back to my most recent gitHub commit and try something else. That only happened twice though, I was really suprised by how the AI was able to execute most of my ideas to the degree of accuracy it achieved.
5. What’s one thing you’re proud of? -
I'm pretty proud of the overall look and vibe. There were definetely many creative liberties taken by the AI, and I absolutely cannot say I could've made this project on my own, but I think doing it in just 180 minutes is quite impressive, even with the use of the AI.
6. What’s one thing you’d improve with more time? -
I'd like to add music, proabably some cooler effects, maybe some more enemy types rather than just plain old buildings, but I think overall I did what I set out to do. (Make a trippy car racing game.)

(P.S - Sorry for people with epilepsy, there is no off button.)
