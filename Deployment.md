## 🛠️ Deployment Steps

### 1. Directory Structure

Ensure your project is organized like this:

```
/psychospeeder
├── index.html
├── /assets (optional - for future images/audio)
└── /scripts (optional - if you modularize the JS later)
```

### 2. Local Testing

To run the project locally:
1. Place `index.html` in a dedicated folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Interact using keyboard controls.

_No server is required since it’s a purely client-side project._
